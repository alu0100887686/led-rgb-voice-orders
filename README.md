# RGB LED control by voice commands:
A basic system which allows us to execute LEDs commands by speech recognition (RNN) and Arduino UNO microcontoller.
# Run:
```
cd src/scripts
python3 GUI.py
# With Arduino: Arduino -> Connect
# Without Arduino: Validation -> Record
```
* RGB LED default pins:
```
# define LED_RED_PIN 5 // LED connected to digital output pin 5 for red color.
# define LED_GREEN_PIN 7 // LED connected to digital output pin 7 for green color.
# define LED_BLUE_PIN 6 // LED connected to digital output pin 6 for blue color.
```
